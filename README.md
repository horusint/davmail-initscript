davmail-initscript
==================

This repository includes Linux initscripts for the [DavMail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net) software.
Since version 4.6.1 this is obsolete as beginning with this release distribution-specific packages include initscripts.
See also [my blog](http://st-devel.net/blmme) for an installation guide and more details.
